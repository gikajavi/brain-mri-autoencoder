The first approach consisted of getting slices on the fly (while the pipeline is running), so that we can decide in the experiment which slices we want to consider), but the first attempts showed that this step is quite CPU-consuming, mainly due to a poor or inexistent optimization. So we use a slicer and so the final dataset consists of pre-processed slices rather than whole volumes.\n\nOne of the hypothesis of this project is that perhaps working with skull-stripped MRIs could lead to better models. But this hypothesis can of course be wrong, so we need to test all the possibilities. In other words, we need the slicer to get both full-skull images and the skull-stripped ones.\n\nAnother important aspect has to do with which slices are actually relevant for the task, since many of them have no information. We are conservative at this point, since discarding so many slices at this point could be an impairment later in the project. The approach that was taken consists of including the majority of the slices but incorporating the amount of relevant info as a part of the file name. Therefore, the final decision of what slices to discard in the training stage can be taken on the fly.\n\nThis notebook needs:\n\n- The original IXI-T1 dataset with all the NIFTI files\n- The filtered deepbrain masks we obtained with the DeepBrain segmentation tool (executed in a local environment) and filtered with sklearn dbscan algorithm\n\nThis notebook generates:\n\n- A directory structure with all the slices generated as PNG files, divided in two subfolders:\n    - full => raw slices without being filtered, i.e. the full skull\n    - skull-stripped => slices obtained from NIFTI volumes and then filtered by applying the corresponding DeepBrain mask","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Libraries\nimport os\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport glob\nimport nibabel as nib\nfrom sklearn import cluster\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom PIL import Image\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-04T18:47:44.978732Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-04T18:47:44.979166Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-04T18:47:45.585146Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-04T18:47:44.97906Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-04T18:47:45.584006Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def print_time():\n    now = datetime.now().time()\n    print(\"now =\", now)       \n\nclass sliceAcquirer:    \n    def __init__(self):\n        self.use_masks = True\n        self.tissue_amount_thresold = 50\n        self.slices = []\n        self.dic_idx = {}\n\n    def get_mri_path(self):\n        return '../input/ixi-t1-dataset'\n    \n    def get_mask_path(self):\n        return '../input/ixifilteredmasks/IXI-filtered-masks'\n\n    def mask_file_from_nii_file(self, nii_name):   \n        path = self.get_mask_path()\n        nii_name = str.replace(nii_name, '.nii', '')    \n        mask_files = glob.glob(f'{path}/{nii_name}*.nii.mask.npy')\n        return mask_files[0]\n\n    def get_mask_from_nii_file(self, file):\n        mask_file_name = self.mask_file_from_nii_file(os.path.basename(file))\n        mask = np.load(mask_file_name)   \n        return mask\n\n    def get_mri_slices(self, file):\n        nifti = nib.load(file).get_fdata()\n       \n        self.dic_idx[file] = {}\n        self.dic_idx[file]['start'] = len(self.slices)\n        \n        volume = nifti\n        if self.use_masks:\n            # Apply the mask to the volume\n            mask = self.get_mask_from_nii_file(file)    \n            skull_stripped_volume = np.multiply(volume, mask)   \n\n        x = np.shape(volume)[0]\n        y = np.shape(volume)[1]\n        z = np.shape(volume)[2]\n                \n        for i in range(0, z):\n            slice = np.squeeze(volume[:, :, i:i+1])\n            ss_slice = np.squeeze(skull_stripped_volume[:, :, i:i+1])\n            unique, counts = np.unique(ss_slice, return_counts=True)\n            d = dict(zip(unique, counts))\n            tissue_amount = x*y -
