Although not directly related with the main project's topic, segentation cal help us improve the accuracy of our models, since only the relevant voxels will feed our AE models. We see this as an important part of the pre-process stage.\n\nDeepBrain implements a U-Net architecture to get masks from brain tissues, so it seems perfectly aligned with the goals of our project. In this notebook, we execute deepbrain Extractor over the whole dataset, i.e. all the volumes, in order to get masks for all of them. Every mask can be seen af a volume of voxels indicating wich voxes.\n\nOnce we have obtained all the masks, we package them in a zip that can be downloaded. The obtained masks can be then applied to the related volume, getting the relevant brain tissues we are interested in.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Installing Deepbrain is tricky because to get it working we need to downgrade from tensorflow 2.X (default in kaggle) and install tf 1.13.1:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Deepbrain requirements:\n!pip install tensorflow==1.13.1\n!pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.13.1\n!pip install deepbrain","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import tensorflow as tf\nprint(tf.__version__)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Sometimes, kaggle raises an error when loading tf 1.x.
